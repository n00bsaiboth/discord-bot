# Simple Discord Bot

This simple Discord bot is based on [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin). Actually, it doesn't do much, but it's still a Discord bot.

## Edit config file

Of course you need configs or an API, so you need to create `config.json` file to the project root. It is as follows,

```
{
    "clientId": "<clientId>",
    "guildId": "<guildId>",
    "token": "<token>"   
}
```

You can get this information from Discord.
